We're building a game for multiple platforms as both a test for ourselves and a productive thing for personal enjoyment and the enrichment of those that will be able to play it. We're currently calling it Karate Chess but it's based on a fictional world we crafted for a previous game project that went by the name Retribution, and primarily involves tactical turn based combat on a hex-grid between various humanoid species, such as goblins and dwarves.
